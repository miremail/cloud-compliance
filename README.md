# cloud-compliance

This project will provide cloud compliance policy mappings with implementations for different known compliance standards, such as ISO27001, NIST, CIS, GDPR and others.

We will use other open-source cloud compliance rules engines, such as cloud-custodian, and others to provide backend implementation.
